# Writing a JSON Parser in TypeScript

This is the repository for the Medium blog post on writing a JSON parser in TypeScript. In the blog post, we walk through the process of writing a JSON parser from scratch and explain each step along the way.

If you'd like to see the full implementation of the JSON parser in TypeScript, The `json-parser.ts` file contains the main parser code, and the `json-parser.test.ts` file contains the unit tests.

I hope this repository is helpful to you in understanding how JSON parsing works and how to write your own JSON parser in TypeScript or any other language.
